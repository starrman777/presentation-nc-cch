     <h2>Introduction</h2>
		   <p>North Carolina has a Concealed Carry Handgun law in place that allows qualifying citizens of our State the opportunity to obtain a permit to carry a concealed handgun.​</p>

​     <p>In order to obtain such permit, a qualified individual must complete a required training in the use of deadly force, carrying a concealed handgun and demonstrate proficiency in the use of the handgun. ​</p>
   </section>
 
    <section id="why-is-training-required">
     <h2>Why Is The Training Required?</h2>
     <p>With the right to carry a concealed handgun, comes a tremendous responsibility. The person carrying the handgun must have complete knowledge of handgun safety, knowledge of the laws regarding use of force, know how and be able to use the handgun safely and in a responsible manner.</p>​

     <p>Most importantly, the person needs to be able to use good judgment in every situation the handgun may be used and how it operates. Whether it’s in self-defense situation or practicing marksmanship or just basic gun handling.​</p>

     <p>Common Law is defined as law that has been developed on the basis of preceding rulings by judges.</p><br>
     <p>Common Law is also known as case law and is of two types – one where judgments passed become new laws where there are no statutes and the other where judges interpret the existing law and determines new boundaries and distinctions.</p>

           Great Bodily Harm is not defined; however the statutory definition of “serious bodily injury” contained in the North Carolina Criminal Law 
           provides guidance as to the type of injuries may qualify as great bodily harm.<br><br>

           permanent <span style="color: red"> of </span> protracted condition that causes extreme pain, or permanent or protracted loss or impairment

       <h4>Sexual Assault</h4>
       <div style="text-align: left;">Sexual Assault
         <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
         A “sexual assault “ would include rape, sexual offense, or forcible crime against nature or attempts to do any such act. (NCPI Crim. 308.70, FN 1)​<br><br>
         
         *Not all sexual assaults justify the use of deadly force!  Much of the law on justified self defense in North Carolina was written before the Legislature 
         redefined sexual offenses in this state.<br>
         </div>
       ​</div>
     </section>     

     <section id="sexual-assault-2">

       <h4>Sexual Assault</h4>
       <div style="text-align: left;">
         <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
         Basically, there are two categories of sexual offense:<br>

           <li>Rape</li>
           <li>Sexual Assault</li>
         </ol><br><br>
         Therefore, if it’s not rape it is sexual assault. Many sexual assault offenses do not meet the standard for inclusion in the justified self defense formula. 
         ONLY sexual assaults that have a risk of death or great bodily harm should be included.

       <div style="text-align: left;">
         <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
           A citizen has the right  in self defense to use only such force as reasonably appeared necessary under the circumstances to protect themselves 
           from death or great bodily harm. In determining the amount of force necessary, and in order to avoid excessive force, the citizen should 
           consider the size, age and strength of the citizen as compared to the attacker, the fierceness of the assault, if any, upon the citizen, 
           whether the attacker possessed a weapon, and the reputation of the attacker for danger and violence, and any other circumstances relevant to 
           this issue. (NCPI Crim. 308.45A)​

           Where an assault being made upon a citizen is insufficient to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of death or great bodily harm, then the 
           use of deadly force by the citizen to protect himself from bodily injury or offensive physical contact is excessive force.<br>

           A citizen who is found to be an aggressor voluntarily provoking the conflict, or who used excessive force can be convicted of voluntary 
           manslaughter even though the use of deadly force complied with the other requirements of self-defense. An instigator, or person using 
           excessive force, is not excused from all criminal liability, but may be guilty of a lesser degree of homicide.

           A citizen may intervene and use deadly force in defense of another person when, under the facts and circumstances, it reasonably 
           appeared necessary to save the other person from an imminent threat of death, great bodily harm, or sexual assault, but only to 
           the extent the other person was entitled to use deadly fore in self defense.

           Excessive force in defense of others is not allowed, and neither the intervener nor the person threatened can be an instigator 
           voluntarily provoking the conflict for deadly force to be used. If you are not sure of the circumstances that initiated the action, 
           it would be advisable to contact a law enforcement agency or attempt to assist using less lethal means rather than immediately 
           imposing the threat of deadly force. ​

       <div style="text-align: left;">
         a-1. To stop a simple assault​.<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
            While a simple assault may be truly terrifying, the law only allows the victim to resist force with 
            equivalent force. Force used to resist a simple assault must be proportionate to the assault. Even a real and legitimate fear 
            of greater injury, standing alone, does not justify use of deadly force.<br><br>
            
            When does a simple assault become an imminent threat of death? When can a victim use deadly force to repel an unarmed attacker? 
            The exact point in time a simple assault becomes aggravated or deadly in nature is often unclear. Repeated blows to vital body 
            areas, choking, continued beating on a helpless or weaken victim, are some indicators.​

         a-2. To stop a simple assault​.<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
            Because the law requires retreat from a simple assault, but does not require retreat from a murderous or felonious assault, an 
            assault victim is once again faced with a decision: when does a simple assault become murderous assault? No clear answer exists 
            for the multitude of circumstances constituting an assault.

           The law requires that there be an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm. The threat must be an imminent danger of death, not 
           remote and uncertain in time and place. If the facts and circumstances are not reasonably apprehended as an immediate danger of death 
           Here and Now, deadly force in self-defense is not allowed as a Justified excuse for homicide.​

         d. Because a trespasser refuses to leave​<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
           Trespassers may be in violation of the law, but the law does not allow deadly force to end the trespass. While non-lethal force is 
           allowed against a trespasser deadly force is not. Old court cases established sequence for using Force to eject trespassers: first, 
           words must be used; second, if words do not work then gentle hands may be laid on the trespasser; if gentle hands do not work, the 
           owner may use whatever force is necessary to remove the trespasser, but may not use of force likely to kill or cause great bodily harm. 
           The prohibition against using deadly force to expel a trespasser does not apply to a trespasser who is immediately threatening death, 
           serious injury, or sexual assault.

            North Carolina law does not give a citizen the right to make a citizen's arrest.  Since the power to make a citizen's arrest does not 
            exist, the right to use deadly force to affect an arrest or prevent escape is not given to citizens. No matter how serious a crime a

       <h4>Use of Force to Protect Property:</h4>
       <div style="text-align: left;">
         <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
		         The law does not permit the use of deadly force solely to protect property, or to prevent theft, or to regain stolen property. An owner can 
		         defend his or her property using reasonable and necessary Force but not deadly force. Non-deadly force to regain possession of stolen 
		         property is lawful, if it is both reasonable and necessary under the circumstances. An owner CANNOT shoot at a thief; before, during, or 
		         after theft. The same rule prohibits deadly force to prevent injury or vandalism to property. ​

          <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
            A different rule applies if life is imminently threatened at the same time the property is taken. For example, an armed robbery is theft 
            through use or threatened use of a deadly weapon. The victim is allowed to respond to the imminent threat to the life of an armed robbery by 
            using deadly force. Deadly force to prevent an armed robbery is force used to protect the life, not to protect property. If only property is 
            threatened, deadly force cannot be used.​​

​          (1) Definition of a handgun​<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;A handgun is defined as a firearm that has a short stock and is designed to be held and fired by the use of 
           a single hand<br><br>

        <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
          The definition of a handgun has two characteristics in the statute.<br><br>
          First, the firearm must have a short stock. <br><br>
          Second, the firearm must be designed to be held and fired by the use of a single hand. <br><br>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Revolvers and semi-automatic pistols are treated alike. </li>
            <li>Caliber of the firearm is not specified. </li>
            <li>While length or configuration of the firearm’s stock is not defined, presumably it must be shorter than the standard

           &nbsp;&nbsp;The statue further requires the concealed weapon be about the person, which generally means it must be concealed

           person is carrying a concealed handgun off of their own premises. In addition, the statute, in N.C.G.S 14-415.11(A),

          3 - Escalation of Force <span style="color: red">make sure numbering is correct</span><br><br>
          
           Escalation of force is merely the increase in the level of force based on that force which is being used against you. Force must be proportionate to the level of force used against you. For instance if you are verbally assaulted you cannot use deadly force to settle the argument. If we were to look at the various levels of force, the escalation would become something like this:​
           
            Physical presence
              Verbal
                Soft hands
                  Hard hands
                    Chemicals  (mace, OC spray)​
                      Impact weapons  (stick, club)​

          The increase in force does not need to follow these various levels. Depending on the level that is used against you and the 
          imminent threat imposed against you, will determine the lawful reaction to the situation.

          A court in any domestic violence protective order can prohibit a party from possessing, purchasing or receiving a firearm for a 
          time fixed in the order. Further, effective September 30, 1996, 18 U.S.C. §921(a) was modified in the “Lautenburg Amendment” 
          to prohibit the possession of firearms and ammunition by anyone convicted of a misdemeanor under federal or state law which has, 
          as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or 
          former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is 
          cohabitating with, or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a 
          spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.

          7. Reciprocity<br><br>

          North Carolina law allows residents of other states who have a Concealed Carry Handgun Permit issued by their state to carry 
          concealed handguns in North Carolina.  For NC permittees who wish to carry in another state you may obtain a current list of 
          those states that honor the NC permit by visiting the N.C. Department of Justice website at www.ncdoj.gov.<br><br>

          Remember, while traveling in other states, you are subject to the laws of that state, so please be aware that the use of deadly 
          force laws may be different as well as those place where carrying concealed is prohibited. Consider contacting the Attorney 
          General’s Office of the state in which you will be traveling for the current laws of that state.

      <div style="text-align: left;">Four cardinal rules of safe gun handling<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">          
        
										<ol>
										 <li>Treat all guns as loaded.</li>
										 <li>Point the muzzle in a safe direction at all times.</li>
										 <li>Keep your finger outside the trigger guard and on the frame until you are:
										   <ul>
										     <li>on target AND</li>
										     <li>have a legal right to fire AND</li>
										     <li>are going to fire</li>
										   </ul>
										 <li>Be sure of your target and what’s around and beyond it.</li>
										</ol><br><br>
										<div>
										  These four basic rules should be applied to every aspect of gun handling. When storing a weapon, when handing the to someone, 
										  or when loading or unloading, be sure of muzzle direction and trigger finger position. Handguns must be operational and the 
										  operator must have an understanding of this operation.</div>

          A Gun Owner's Responsibilities<br><br>
          
          Americans enjoy a right that citizens of many other countries do not-The Right to Own Firearms.  But with this right come responsibilities.
          It is the gun owner's responsibility to store, operate and maintain his or her firearms safely.  It is the gun owner's responsibility to
          ensure that unauthorized or untrained individuals cannot gain access to his or her firearms.  And it is the gun owner's responsibility to
          learn and obey all applicable laws that pertain to the purchase, possession and use of a firearm in his or her locale.  Guns are neither
          safe nor unsafe by themselves.  When gun owners learn and practice responsible ownership, Guns are Safe.

      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">    
SINGLE-ACTION
Each pull of the trigger performs a single action: releasing the hammer. The hammer must be manually cocked for the first shot.
TRADITIONAL DOUBLE-ACTION
The initial long, heavy trigger pull both cocks and releases the hammer. Each subsequent shot is fired in the singe-action mode.
DOUBLE-ACTION-ONLY
Each pull of the trigger both cocks and releases the hammer, as with a double-action revolver

      <h2>Storage of the handgun</h2>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;"> 
a) Use of commercial trigger locks
Various commercial rigger locks are available, they cover the trigger to prevent someone from using the weapon or firing it accidentally. These devices may not allow quick access to the weapon in a personal defense atmosphere. Read the manufacturer’s procedure for placing the trigger lock on the handgun. Most manufacturers of trigger licks require the weapon to be unloaded prior to placing the trigger lock on the handgun.
b) Storage cases – hard and soft cases
Many different types of hard and soft cases are commercially available to store handguns. Many come with small locks to secure the weapon within the case allowing the weapon to be stored loaded. For defensive purposes this may be time consuming and is less than ideal for preventing theft.

        <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">   
c) Padlocks and other locking devices
For storage and safety purposes, padlocks can be used to safely secure the weapon. By locking a padlock around the top strap of a revolver, the cylinder cannot be closed. If the padlock is large enough, it can be placed behind the trigger and prohibit the movement of the trigger. Some manufactures make a cable and lock system that can be used on virtually any firearm. The cable can be passed through the magazine well and out the ejection port of the semiautomatic pistol to prevent both loading and firing.
d) Breech locks
Commercial breech lock are now available for the different sizes of semiautomatic pistols. These locks are placed within the breech, then when the key is turned, extend into the chamber and cannot be removed.

g) Where to and where not to keep weapons in the home
When determining where to store a handgun in the home, consideration must be given to several factors.
1st: are there minors in the home or are there likely to be minors visiting the home? Consideration of the Storage of Firearms to Protect Minors statute,
N.C.G.S 14-315.1 may help in determining the type of access and storage you will need.
2nd: weapons, especially loaded weapons, should be kept out of sight. If the handgun is not going to be used for personal protection, it should be secured unloaded in a safe, cabinet, or lockable box. Weapons should not be kept on bedside tables or on night stands. As a general rule, the weapon should be approximately three steps from the bed. This ensures a conscious effort on the part of the occupant to obtain the weapon, and this effort will allow the home owner the opportunity to ensure that they are fully awake. Several serious in juries and fatalities have occurred from homeowners hearing a noise or seeing a shadow and firing a weapon kept at bedside only to shoot themselves or a spouse. Handgun owners may consider storing the weapon with ammunition in a loading device nearly for use in personal defense.

        <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
A hangfire is a perceptible delay in the ignition of a cartridge after the primer or case rim has been struck by the firing pin. This delay may last several seconds.
When a cartridge fails to fire immediately, it will not be known if the problem is a misfire or hangfire.
Because a hangfire condition can cause the pistol to fire after a substantial delay, the pistol should be kept pointed in a safe direction for at least 30 seconds before the action is opened to remove the cartridge.

        <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
1. Carrying the handgun in a briefcase or luggage
Weapons carried in a briefcase or luggage should be secured in some manner either in a holster or a carry case. When traveling by air and carrying a handgun in luggage, remember you must comply with TSA regulations regarding the transportation of the weapon. When carrying a weapon in a briefcase the type of the weapon and the safety features with which the weapon is equipped may have some determination as to how the weapon is secured. For instance, if the weapon does not have the some type of hammer block that prevents the weapon from firing when the hammer is struck, the loose weapon in the briefcase could hit the side of the briefcase or an object inside and cause a discharge. The weapon should be secured inside either a case or a holster in such a manner as to negate the possibility of such an accident. Holsters should be constructed in such a manner as to completely cover the trigger and the trigger guard in order to prohibit items such as pens, pencils, mini flashlights, magic markers, etc. from getting inside the trigger guard and thus supplying pressure to the trigger. Weapons carried in luggage merely for transporting should be unloaded. The weapon carried in luggage is not readily available for personal protection therefore it should be stored safely.

2. Carrying the handgun in a purse
Carrying the handgun in a purse is much like carrying the weapon in a briefcase. First, the safety features of the weapon need to be examined. Second, think about the use of the weapon. If it is for personal protection then you should be concerned with immediate access, not fishing for it in the bottom of the purse. Third, what else is in the purse that could cause an accidental discharge? Keys, lipstick, pens and pencils are all capable of getting inside an exposed trigger guard. Several holster companies offer purses with built-in holsters to prevent such a thing from happening.

3. Carrying the handgun on the person.. a) Holsters and holster election.
Holsters should be selected for security as well as comfort. The trigger guard should be covered as much as possible. The type of weapon and the use of the weapon may dictate the availability of the holster. Holsters can be crossed or directional draw. Cross draw holsters are worn on the support site while directional draw holsters are worn on the dominant side. Both types can be inside the pants or outside the pants. They can be equipped with belt loops, a paddle or Velcro to secure it to the waistband. Ankle holsters are worn on the inside of the support ankle. Shoulder holsters can be vertical or horizontal. Fanny packs are normally used as cross draw holsters. Other innovative holsters are ones carried in the small of the back various pocket holsters carried inside the pants or jacket pockets, and the belly band holsters worn under clothing around the waist.

3. Carrying the handgun on the person.. b) In a pocket or waistband
When the handgun is carried inside the pocket or waistband some type of holster is highly recommended. It is all too easy to reach inside the pocket and grasp the weapon the wrong way or to snag the weapon n the clothing when trying to withdraw the weapon from the pocket or waistband. The weapon can easily fall out if jogging or running and it will quickly wear through the thin cotton in most pockets.

3. Carrying the handgun on the person.. c) Location on the person
Consideration should be given to how the handgun is to be used and for what purpose.
If used for self-defense or personal protection, the handgun should be easily accessible yet safe. In addition, handgun ownership does not make you proficient with the weapon or withdrawing the handgun from concealment. Learning to use the handgun properly is important, but learning to use the weapons in the manner it is to be carried is of high importance.

4. Carrying the concealed handgun in a vehicle.
When carrying the concealed handgun in a vehicle, it must be readily accessible or within reach to satisfy the conditions of concealment. If the handgun is carried under the seat, consideration should be given to securing the weapon in a holster and securing a holster with Velcro or some other means to the floorboard in order to prevent the weapon from sliding further under the seat out of reach or sliding under the feet when the brakes are applied. When carrying the handgun in the console consider any item that might tangle the handgun or any object that might interfere with the trigger if the handgun is not secured in a holster or pouch.

      <h2>Presentation Techniques</h2>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;"> 
The presentation or draw is as essential in the personal protection arena as is the shooting of the weapon itself. The greatest shooter in the world is helpless if he or she is unable to access the weapon in a crisis situation. Practice is most important in learning to draw or present the handgun. Learning this skill takes time but DOES NOT REQUIRE AMMUNITION. Dry fire practice or practicing with an unloaded handgun is one of the simplest ways to learn to effectively present the handgun, and this practice IS SAFE!

1. Holsters and the presentation from the various types of holsters (i.e. ankle holsters, shoulder holsters, directional draw, cross draw, small of back, inside the pants)
When a holster is used, the draw is normally divided into four steps. These four steps are:
1) establish the grip
2) clear the holster
3) center the hands on the body 4) extend to the target

        <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">    
First the grip is established in the holster. It is important that a good grip be established prior to removing the handgun from the holster and if the handgun is carried concealed you may have to clear piece of clothing out of the way of the grip. This saves time since the grip should not have to be readjusted after getting it out of the holster. Second, the weapon clears the holster. Third. The weapon is brought up along the centerline of the body as it is rotated towards the target. If a two-hand grip is used, it is established at this point. Again, lots of practice is required to master the four steps from a specific holster type. When using an ankle holster the shooter should first kneel down on the shooting side knee to access the holster. The four steps of the draw can be followed. When using a shoulder holster it should be secured to the belt or pants.
REMEMBER THE FINGER NEVER ENGAGES THE TRIGGER UNTIL YOU INTEND TO FIRE.
THE TRIGGER FINGER SHOULD LIE ALONG THE FRAME OF THE WEAPON DURING THE DRAW.

2. Fanny packs
When using a fanny pack first open the pack by unzipping or pulling open the Velcro enclosure. This is done with a rapid jerk. It helps if the fanny pack is secured to the belt.
3. Presentation from a purse
Once the grip has been established on the weapon, the purse should either be supported by the support hand or simply dropped or thrown. Throwing the purse can in fact be a distraction. An assailant’s eyes may be drawn to the press as it comes towards him or her rather than the hands as the weapon is removed.

        <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">   
4. Presentation from underneath a coat, jacket or clothing
In order to remove the weapon the clothing must be pushed or pulled out of the way to both achieve a grip on the weapon and to ensure that when the hanging is drawn it does not snag on any loose clothing that would prevent the use of the handgun in a defensive posture. One simple method is a drag were the four fingers of the hand hook at the center line of the body and actually dragged the clothing back around the weapon. Where and how the holster is worn will determine which hand is used. For a directional draw holsters, the shooting hand hooks and drags the clothing. For a cross- draw holster the support hand hooks and drags the clothing as a shooting hand grasps the weapon. When using a belly band type of holster the clothing is normally pulled up to reach the handgun, but it should be pulled tight against the body to prevent the pistol from snagging the clothing.

5. Recovery to the holster

When firing is complete the weapon will be returned to the holster. The recovery or re-holster also has four steps. The first step is to scan or a look around. Remember to ask yourself did I hit them, did it work, or are there more of them, is it safe to put the gun away. Second, bring the gun to the ready position, muzzle pointed down approximately 45 degrees, triceps touching ribcage and breathe. Make the weapon safe, for example engage the safety, decock, etc. Finally return the weapon to the holster preferably with only one hand. The eyes should not look at the holster to recover to the holster. Remember you have removed the weapon from the holster because of a serious social encounter. The holster is not the threat so continue to look for where the threat was.
