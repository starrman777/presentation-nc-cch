     <h2>Introduction</h2>
		   <p>North Carolina has a Concealed Carry Handgun law in place that allows qualifying citizens of our State the opportunity to obtain a permit to carry a concealed handgun.​</p>

​     <p>In order to obtain such permit, a qualified individual must complete a required training in the use of deadly force, carrying a concealed handgun and demonstrate proficiency in the use of the handgun. ​</p>
   </section>
 
    <section id="why-is-training-required">
     <h2>Why Is The Training Required?</h2>
     <p>With the right to carry a concealed handgun, comes a tremendous responsibility. The person carrying the handgun must have complete knowledge of handgun safety, knowledge of the laws regarding use of force, know how and be able to use the handgun safely and in a responsible manner.</p>​

     <p>Most importantly, the person needs to be able to use good judgment in every situation the handgun may be used and how it operates. Whether it’s in self-defense situation or practicing marksmanship or just basic gun handling.​</p>

   <section id="common-law">
     <h2>Common Law</h2>
     <p>Common Law is defined as law that has been developed on the basis of preceding rulings by judges.</p><br>
     <p>Common Law is also known as case law and is of two types – one where judgments passed become new laws where there are no statutes and the other where judges interpret the existing law and determines new boundaries and distinctions.</p>

			      e1. <div style="margin-left: 30px;">Retreat​: A citizen faced with an imminent threat of death or great bodily injury generally does not have a duty to retreat prior to using deadly force, when all the other elements of self defense are satisfied. Regardless, it may be a good idea to retreat to safety if possible, as this may avoid use of deadly force, but also may remove the citizen from a situation that could result in loss of his own life.</div>
