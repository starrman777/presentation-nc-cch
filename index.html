					 <h2>Introduction</h2>
					 <div style="text-align: left;">
							 <p>North Carolina has a Concealed Carry Handgun law in place that allows qualifying citizens of our State the 
							 opportunity to obtain a permit to carry a concealed handgun.​</p>
				 
				​     <smaller>In order to obtain such permit, a qualified individual must:<br>
							 <ul>
							   <li>complete a required training in:
									   <ul>
										 <li>the use of deadly force ... AND</li>
										 <li>carrying a concealed handgun</li>
									   </ul>
							   </li>
							   <li>demonstrate proficiency in the use of the handgun</li>
							 </ul>

					<section id="why-is-training-required">
					 <h2>Why Is The Training Required?</h2>
					 <div style="text-align: left; font-size: 34px;">
				
					   With the right to carry a concealed handgun, comes a tremendous responsibility.<br><br>
					   The person carrying the handgun must have:<br> 
							 <ul>
							   <li class="fragment fade-in">complete knowledge of handgun safety</li>
							   <li class="fragment fade-in">knowledge of the laws regarding use of force</li>
							   <li class="fragment fade-in">the ability to use the weapon safely and in a responsible manner</li>
							 </ul>
				  
					   <span class="fragment fade-in">
						 Most importantly, the person needs to be able to use good judgment in every situation the handgun may be used 
						 and how it operates. Whether it’s in self-defense situation or practicing marksmanship or just basic gun handling.​

					   Common Law is defined as law that has been developed on the basis of preceding rulings by judges.<br><br>
					 
					   Common Law is also known as case law and is of two types:
					   <ul>
						 <li class="fragment fade-in">one where judgments passed become new laws where there are no statutes</li>
						 <li class="fragment fade-in">and the other where judges interpret the existing law and determines new boundaries and distinctions.</li>

					   <h4>Immediate Danger</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 <div style="margin-left: 30px;">Imminent Harm means “immediate danger”, or is “about to” happen.</div>

					   <h4>Serious Bodily Injury</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
						   Great Bodily Harm is not defined; however the statutory definition of “serious bodily injury” contained in the North Carolina Criminal Law 
						   provides guidance as to the type of injuries may qualify as great bodily harm.<br><br>
						   
						   “Serious bodily injury” includes injury that creates a substantial risk of death, or that causes serious permanent disfigurement, coma, a 
						   permanent or protracted condition that causes extreme pain, or permanent or protracted loss or impairment 
						   of the function of any bodily member or organ, or that results in prolonged hospitalization.

					   <h2>Common Law</h2>
					   <h4>Sexual Assault</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">Sexual Assault
						 <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
						 A “sexual assault “ would include rape, sexual offense, or forcible crime against nature or attempts to do any such act. (NCPI Crim. 308.70, FN 1)​<br><br>
						 
						 *Not all sexual assaults justify the use of deadly force!  Much of the law on justified self defense in North Carolina was written before the Legislature 
						 redefined sexual offenses in this state.<br>
						 </div>
					   ​</div>
					 </section>     
				
					 <section id="sexual-assault-2">
					   <h2>Common Law</h2>
					   <h4>Sexual Assault</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
						 Basically, there are two categories of sexual offense:<br>
						 <ol>
						   <li>Rape</li>
						   <li>Sexual Assault</li>
						 </ol><br><br>
						 Therefore, if it’s not rape it is sexual assault. Many sexual assault offenses do not meet the standard for inclusion in the justified self defense formula. 
						 ONLY sexual assaults that have a risk of death or great bodily harm should be included.

					   <h2>Common Law</h2>
					   <h4>Excessive Force</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
						   A citizen has the right  in self defense to use only such force as reasonably appeared necessary under the circumstances to protect themselves 
						   from death or great bodily harm. In determining the amount of force necessary, and in order to avoid excessive force, the citizen should 
						   consider the size, age and strength of the citizen as compared to the attacker, the fierceness of the assault, if any, upon the citizen, 
						   whether the attacker possessed a weapon, and the reputation of the attacker for danger and violence, and any other circumstances relevant to 
						   this issue. (NCPI Crim. 308.45A)​

					 <section id="excessive-force-2">
					   <h2>Common Law</h2>
					   <h4>Excessive Force</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
						   Where an assault being made upon a citizen is insufficient to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of death or great bodily harm, then the 
						   use of deadly force by the citizen to protect himself from bodily injury or offensive physical contact is excessive force.<br>
						   ( State v Clay, 297 N.C. 555 (1979))​

					   <h2>Common Law</h2>
					   <h4>Aggressor</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
						   A citizen who is found to be an aggressor voluntarily provoking the conflict, or who used excessive force can be convicted of voluntary 
						   manslaughter even though the use of deadly force complied with the other requirements of self-defense. An instigator, or person using 
						   excessive force, is not excused from all criminal liability, but may be guilty of a lesser degree of homicide.

					   <h2>Common Law</h2>
					   <h4>Aggressor</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
						   A citizen who is an aggressor voluntarily provoking a conflict leading to deadly force can avoid criminal responsibility for deadly 
						   force only if the aggressor attempts to withdraw from the conflict before using deadly force and give notice of withdrawal to the 
						   adversary. ​

						   “One enters a fight voluntarily if one uses toward one’s opponent abusive language which, considering all of the circumstances,

						   (From NCPI Crim. 206.310)<br><br>
						   
						   A citizen who provokes a fight through an unlawful assault would likewise be considered an aggressor.<br>

					   <h4>Deadly Force in Defense of Others</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
						   A citizen may intervene and use deadly force in defense of another person when, under the facts and circumstances, it reasonably 
						   appeared necessary to save the other person from an imminent threat of death, great bodily harm, or sexual assault, but only to 
						   the extent the other person was entitled to use deadly force in self defense.

					   <h4>Deadly Force in Defense of Others</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
						   Excessive force in defense of others is not allowed, and neither the intervener nor the person threatened can be an instigator 
						   voluntarily provoking the conflict for deadly force to be used. If you are not sure of the circumstances that initiated the action, 
						   it would be advisable to contact a law enforcement agency or attempt to assist using less lethal means rather than immediately 
						   imposing the threat of deadly force. ​

					   <h4>Deadly Force MAY NOT be Used:</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 a-1. To stop a simple assault​.<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 31px;">
							While a simple assault may be truly terrifying, the law only allows the victim to resist force with 
							equivalent force. Force used to resist a simple assault must be proportionate to the assault. Even a real and legitimate fear 
							of greater injury, standing alone, does not justify use of deadly force.<br><br>
							
							When does a simple assault become an imminent threat of death? When can a victim use deadly force to repel an unarmed attacker? 
							The exact point in time a simple assault becomes aggravated or deadly in nature is often unclear. Repeated blows to vital body 
							areas, choking, continued beating on a helpless or weaken victim, are some indicators.​

					   <h4>Deadly Force MAY NOT be Used:</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 a-2. To stop a simple assault​.<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
							Because the law requires retreat from a simple assault, but does not require retreat from a murderous or felonious assault, an

							for the multitude of circumstances constituting an assault.

						   The law requires that there be an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm. The threat must be an imminent danger of death, not 
						   remote and uncertain in time and place. If the facts and circumstances are not reasonably apprehended as an immediate danger of death 
						   Here and Now, deadly force in self-defense is not allowed as a Justified excuse for homicide.​

						   Trespassers may be in violation of the law, but the law does not allow deadly force to end the trespass. While non-lethal force is 
						   allowed against a trespasser deadly force is not. Old court cases established sequence for using Force to eject trespassers: first, 
						   words must be used; second, if words do not work then gentle hands may be laid on the trespasser; if gentle hands do not work, the 
						   owner may use whatever force is necessary to remove the trespasser, but may not use of force likely to kill or cause great bodily harm. 
						   The prohibition against using deadly force to expel a trespasser does not apply to a trespasser who is immediately threatening death, 
						   serious injury, or sexual assault.

							North Carolina law does not give a citizen the right to make a citizen's arrest.  Since the power to make a citizen's arrest does not

					   <h4>Use of Force to Protect Property:</h4>
					   <div style="text-align: left;">
						 <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
								 The law does not permit the use of deadly force solely to protect property, or to prevent theft, or to regain stolen property. An owner can 
								 defend his or her property using reasonable and necessary Force but not deadly force. Non-deadly force to regain possession of stolen 
								 property is lawful, if it is both reasonable and necessary under the circumstances. An owner CANNOT shoot at a thief; before, during, or 
								 after theft. The same rule prohibits deadly force to prevent injury or vandalism to property. ​

						<div style="text-align: left;">
						  <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
							A different rule applies if life is imminently threatened at the same time the property is taken. For example, an armed robbery is theft 
							through use or threatened use of a deadly weapon. The victim is allowed to respond to the imminent threat to the life of an armed robbery by 
							using deadly force. Deadly force to prevent an armed robbery is force used to protect the life, not to protect property. If only property is

								  A Gun Owner's Responsibilities<br><br>
								  
								  Americans enjoy a right that citizens of many other countries do not-The Right to Own Firearms.  But with this right come responsibilities.
								  It is the gun owner's responsibility to store, operate and maintain his or her firearms safely.  It is the gun owner's responsibility to
								  ensure that unauthorized or untrained individuals cannot gain access to his or her firearms.  And it is the gun owner's responsibility to
								  learn and obey all applicable laws that pertain to the purchase, possession and use of a firearm in his or her locale.  Guns are neither
								  safe nor unsafe by themselves.  When gun owners learn and practice responsible ownership, Guns are Safe.

									<li>Various commercial trigger locks are available, they cover the trigger to prevent someone from using the weapon 
									  or firing it accidentally. These devices may not allow quick access to the weapon in a personal defense atmosphere. 
									  Read the manufacturer’s procedure for placing the trigger lock on the handgun. Most manufacturers of trigger licks

								  </ul>
								  <br><br>
								  <h4>Storage cases – hard and soft cases</h4>
								  <ul>
									<li>Many different types of hard and soft cases are commercially available to store handguns. Many come 
									  with small locks to secure the weapon within the case allowing the weapon to be stored loaded. For 
									  defensive purposes this may be time consuming and is less than ideal for preventing theft.

								   <h4>Padlocks and other locking devices</h4> 
								  <ul>
									<li>For storage and safety purposes, padlocks can be used to safely secure the weapon. By locking a 
									  padlock around the top strap of a revolver, the cylinder cannot be closed. If the padlock is large 
									  enough, it can be placed behind the trigger and prohibit the movement of the trigger. Some manufactures 
									  make a cable and lock system that can be used on virtually any firearm. The cable can be passed through 
									  the magazine well and out the ejection port of the semiautomatic pistol to prevent both loading and 
									  firing.

								  When determining where to store a handgun in the home, consideration must be given to several factors.<br>
								  <ul>
						
									<li>
									  2nd: weapons, especially loaded weapons, should be kept out of sight. If the handgun is not going 
									  to be used for personal protection, it should be secured unloaded in a safe, cabinet, or lockable box. 
									  Weapons should not be kept on bedside tables or on night stands. As a general rule, the weapon should 
									  be approximately three steps from the bed. This ensures a conscious effort on the part of the occupant 
									  to obtain the weapon, and this effort will allow the home owner the opportunity to ensure that they are 
									  fully awake. Several serious in juries and fatalities have occurred from homeowners hearing a noise or 
									  seeing a shadow and firing a weapon kept at bedside only to shoot themselves or a spouse. Handgun owners 
									  may consider storing the weapon with ammunition in a loading device nearly for use in personal defense.

								<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
								  When shooting a pistol with iron sights, visual focus should be on the front sight. This will leave the 
								  target and rear sight slightly fuzzy, as shown at left, but clear enough to establish proper sight alignment 
								  and sight picture.

							  <h2>Breath Control</h2>
							  <div style="text-align: left;">
								<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">   
								  Breath control minimizes the body movement produced by breathing, which can impair good shooting.<br><br>
								  
								  <ul>
									<li>Take a breath before each shot, let out enough air to be comfortable, and then simply stop 
									breathing while firing the shot</li>
									<li>Avoid holding the breath too long—this can cause tremors</li>

							  <h2>Hold Control</h2>
							  <div style="text-align: left;">
								<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">   
								  Hold control allows the shooter to maintain proper sight alignment and sight picture while firing the shot.<br>
								  
								  <ul>
									<li>A proper grip is critical to hold control</li>
									<li>One goal of hold control is to minimize the arc of movement</li>

							  <h2>Arc Of Movement</h2>
							  <div style="text-align: left;">
								<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">

							<section>
							  <h2>Trigger Control</h2>
							  <div style="text-align: left;">
								<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">  
								  Trigger control is the proper method of activating the trigger to minimize movement that can misalign the 
								  sights.<br><br>
								  
								  <ul>
									<li>Trigger is between fingertip and first joint of index finger</li>
									<li>Trigger is squeezed straight rearward in a smooth, continuous movement</li>
									<li>The trigger squeeze should produce a “surprise break”</li>
									<li>Trigger squeeze and sight alignment are done while maintaining minimum arc of movement</li>

									  Weapons carried in a briefcase or luggage should be secured in some manner either in a holster or a carry

									  When carrying a weapon in a briefcase the type of the weapon and the safety features with which the weapon 
									  is equipped may have some determination as to how the weapon is secured.<br><br>
									  
									  For instance, if the weapon does not have the some type of hammer block that prevents the weapon from firing 
									  when the hammer is struck, the loose weapon in the briefcase could hit the side of the briefcase or an object 
									  inside and cause a discharge. The weapon should be secured inside either a case or a holster in such a 
									  manner as to negate the possibility of such an accident.<br><br>

									  Holsters should be constructed in such a manner as to completely cover the trigger and the trigger guard in 
									  order to prohibit items such as pens, pencils, mini flashlights, magic markers, etc. from getting inside the 
									  trigger guard and thus supplying pressure to the trigger. <br><br>
									  
									  When traveling by air and carrying a handgun in luggage, remember you must comply with TSA regulations 
									  regarding the transportation of the weapon.<br><br> 
									  
									  Weapons carried in luggage merely for transporting should be unloaded. The weapon 
									  carried in luggage is not readily available for personal protection therefore it should be stored safely.

									   holsters are worn on the dominant side. 
									   <br><br>
									   
									   Both types can be inside the pants or outside the pants.

									 Consideration should be given to how the handgun is to be used and for what purpose.  If used for

									 concealment. Learning to use the handgun properly is important, but learning to use the weapons in

									<h4>4. Carrying the concealed handgun in a vehicle.</h4>
							
									When carrying the concealed handgun in a vehicle, it must be readily accessible or within reach to satisfy 
									the conditions of concealment. If the handgun is carried under the seat, consideration should be given to 
									securing the weapon in a holster and securing a holster with Velcro or some other means to the floorboard 
									in order to prevent the weapon from sliding further under the seat out of reach or sliding under the feet 
									when the brakes are applied. When carrying the handgun in the console consider any item that might tangle 
									the handgun or any object that might interfere with the trigger if the handgun is not secured in a holster 
									or pouch.

							<section>
							  <h2>Presentation Techniques</h2>
							  <div style="text-align: left;">
								<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;"> 
								  The presentation or draw is as essential in the personal protection arena as is the shooting of the weapon 
								  itself. The greatest shooter in the world is helpless if he or she is unable to access the weapon in a 
								  crisis situation.<br><br>
								  
								  <b>Practice</b> is most important in learning to draw or present the handgun. Learning this 
								  skill takes time but DOES NOT REQUIRE AMMUNITION. Dry fire practice or practicing with an unloaded handgun 
								  is one of the simplest ways to learn to effectively present the handgun, and this practice IS SAFE!
								 
								</div>
							  </div>
							</section> 
						
							<section>
							  <h2>Presentation Techniques</h2>
							  <div style="text-align: left;">
								<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;"> 
								  1. Holsters and the presentation from the various types of holsters (i.e. ankle holsters, shoulder holsters, 
								  directional draw, cross draw, small of back, inside the pants)<br><br>
						
								  <div>
									When a holster is used, the draw is normally divided into four steps. These four steps are:<br>
									<ol>
									  <li>establish the grip</li>
									  <li>clear the holster</li>
									  <li>center the hands on the body</li>
									  <li>extend to the target</li>
									</ol>    
								  </div>   
								</div>
							  </div>
							</section> 
						
							
							<section>
							  <h2>Presentation Techniques</h2>
							  <div style="text-align: left;">
								<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">   
								  First the grip is established in the holster. It is important that a good grip be established prior to removing 
								  the handgun from the holster and if the handgun is carried concealed you may have to clear piece of clothing 
								  out of the way of the grip. This saves time since the grip should not have to be readjusted after getting it 
								  out of the holster. <br><br>
								  
								  Second, the weapon clears the holster. <br><br>
								  
								  Third. The weapon is brought up along the centerline of the body as it is rotated towards the target. If a 
								  two-hand grip is used, it is established at this point.<br><br>
							  
								</div>
							  </div>
							</section> 
						
							<section>
							  <h2>Presentation Techniques</h2>
							  <div style="text-align: left;">
								<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">   
								  
								  Again, lots of practice is required to master the four steps from a specific holster type. When using an ankle 
								  holster the shooter should first kneel down on the shooting side knee to access the holster. The four steps 
								  of the draw can be followed. When using a shoulder holster it should be secured to the belt or pants.<br><br>
								  
								  REMEMBER THE FINGER NEVER ENGAGES THE TRIGGER UNTIL YOU INTEND TO FIRE.
								  THE TRIGGER FINGER SHOULD LIE ALONG THE FRAME OF THE WEAPON DURING THE DRAW.
							  
								</div>

							</section> 
						
							<section>
							  <h2>Presentation Techniques</h2>
							  <div style="text-align: left;">
								<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">   
								  2. Fanny packs<br><br>
						
								  When using a fanny pack first open the pack by unzipping or pulling open the Velcro enclosure. This is done 
								  with a rapid jerk. It helps if the fanny pack is secured to the belt.<br><br>
						
								  3. Presentation from a purse<br>
								  Once the grip has been established on the weapon, the purse should either be supported by the support hand or 
								  simply dropped or thrown. Throwing the purse can in fact be a distraction. An assailant’s eyes may be drawn to 
								  the press as it comes towards him or her rather than the hands as the weapon is removed.

							  <div style="text-align: left;">
								<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">   
								  4. Presentation from underneath a coat, jacket or clothing<br>
								  
								  <div class="fragment fade-in">
								  In order to remove the weapon the clothing must be pushed or pulled out of the way to both achieve a grip on 
								  the weapon and to ensure that when the hanging is drawn it does not snag on any loose clothing that would 
								  prevent the use of the handgun in a defensive posture.
							</div>
								  
								  <div class="fragment fade-in">
								  One simple method is a drag were the four fingers of the hand hook at the center line of the body and actually 
								  dragged the clothing back around the weapon. Where and how the holster is worn will determine which hand is used.

								  4. Presentation from underneath a coat, jacket or clothing<br>
								  
								  <div class="fragment fade-in">
								  For a directional draw holsters, the shooting hand hooks and drags the clothing. For a cross- draw holster the 
								  support hand hooks and drags the clothing as a shooting hand grasps the weapon.
							</div>
								  
								  <div class="fragment fade-in">
								  When using a belly band type of holster the clothing is normally pulled up to reach the handgun, but it should be 
								  pulled tight against the body to prevent the pistol from snagging the clothing.

								  5. Recovery to the holster<br><br>
								  
								  <div class="fragment fade-in"> 
								  When firing is complete the weapon will be returned to the holster. The recovery or re-holster also has four 
								  steps.
							</div>
								  
								  
								  <ol>
									<li class="fragment fade-in">The first step is to scan or a look around. Remember to ask yourself did I hit them, did it work, or 
									  are there more of them, is it safe to put the gun away. </li>
									<li class="fragment fade-in">Second, bring the gun to the ready position, muzzle pointed down approximately 45 degrees, triceps 
									  touching ribcage and breathe.</li>
									<li class="fragment fade-in">Make the weapon safe, for example engage the safety, decock, etc.</li>
									<li class="fragment fade-in">Finally return the weapon to the holster preferably with only one hand. The eyes should not look at the 
									  holster to recover to the holster. Remember you have removed the weapon from the holster because of a 
									  serious social encounter. The holster is not the threat so continue to look for where the threat was.</li>

						<h2>How to Handle a Misfire or a Hangfire</h2>
						<div style="text-align: left;">
						  <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
							
							<div class="fragment fade-in">
							When a cartridge fails to fire immediately, it will not be known if the problem is a misfire or hangfire.<br>
							Because a hangfire condition can cause the pistol to fire after a substantial delay, the pistol should be 
							kept pointed in a safe direction for at least 30 seconds before the action is opened to remove the cartridge.

						<h2>Squib Load</h2>
						<div style="text-align: left;">
						  <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;"> 
							A squib load is a cartridge developing less than normal pressure or velocity upon ignition. A squib load can 
							cause a bullet to fail to exit the muzzle and lodge in the bore.<br><br>
							
							If signs of a squib load are encountered:<br>
							
							<ul>
							  <li class="fragment fade-in">Reduced noise</li>
							  <li class="fragment fade-in">Reduced muzzle flash</li>
							  <li class="fragment fade-in">Reduced recoil</li>
							</ul>
							
							<br><br>
							Stop firing immediately, safely open the action and check the bore for obstructions.<br>
