     <h2>Introduction</h2>
		   <p>North Carolina has a Concealed Carry Handgun law in place that allows qualifying citizens of our State the opportunity to obtain a permit to carry a concealed handgun.​</p>

​     <p>In order to obtain such permit, a qualified individual must complete a required training in the use of deadly force, carrying a concealed handgun and demonstrate proficiency in the use of the handgun. ​</p>
   </section>
 
    <section id="why-is-training-required">
     <h2>Why Is The Training Required?</h2>
     <p>With the right to carry a concealed handgun, comes a tremendous responsibility. The person carrying the handgun must have complete knowledge of handgun safety, knowledge of the laws regarding use of force, know how and be able to use the handgun safely and in a responsible manner.</p>​

     <p>Most importantly, the person needs to be able to use good judgment in every situation the handgun may be used and how it operates. Whether it’s in self-defense situation or practicing marksmanship or just basic gun handling.​</p>

     <p>Common Law is defined as law that has been developed on the basis of preceding rulings by judges.</p><br>
     <p>Common Law is also known as case law and is of two types – one where judgments passed become new laws where there are no statutes and the other where judges interpret the existing law and determines new boundaries and distinctions.</p>

           Great Bodily Harm is not defined; however the statutory definition of “serious bodily injury” contained in the North Carolina Criminal Law 
           provides guidance as to the type of injuries may qualify as great bodily harm.<br><br>
           
           “Serious bodily injury” includes injury that creates a substantial risk of death, or that causes serious permanent disfigurement, coma, a 
           permanent <span style="color: red"> of </span> protracted condition that causes extreme pain, or permanent or protracted loss or impairment

       <h4>Sexual Assault</h4>
       <div style="text-align: left;">Sexual Assault
         <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
         A “sexual assault “ would include rape, sexual offense, or forcible crime against nature or attempts to do any such act. (NCPI Crim. 308.70, FN 1)​<br><br>
         
         *Not all sexual assaults justify the use of deadly force!  Much of the law on justified self defense in North Carolina was written before the Legislature 
         redefined sexual offenses in this state.<br>
         </div>
       ​</div>
     </section>     

     <section id="sexual-assault-2">
       <h2>Common Law</h2>
       <h4>Sexual Assault</h4>
       <div style="text-align: left;">
         <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
         Basically, there are two categories of sexual offense:<br>
         <ol>
           <li>Rape</li>
           <li>Sexual Assault</li>
         </ol><br><br>
         Therefore, if it’s not rape it is sexual assault. Many sexual assault offenses do not meet the standard for inclusion in the justified self defense formula. 
         ONLY sexual assaults that have a risk of death or great bodily harm should be included.

       <h4>Excessive Force</h4>
       <div style="text-align: left;">
         <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
           A citizen has the right  in self defense to use only such force as reasonably appeared necessary under the circumstances to protect themselves 
           from death or great bodily harm. In determining the amount of force necessary, and in order to avoid excessive force, the citizen should 
           consider the size, age and strength of the citizen as compared to the attacker, the fierceness of the assault, if any, upon the citizen, 
           whether the attacker possessed a weapon, and the reputation of the attacker for danger and violence, and any other circumstances relevant to 
           this issue. (NCPI Crim. 308.45A)​

         <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
           Where an assault being made upon a citizen is insufficient to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of death or great bodily harm, then the 
           use of deadly force by the citizen to protect himself from bodily injury or offensive physical contact is excessive force.<br>

           A citizen who is found to be an aggressor voluntarily provoking the conflict, or who used excessive force can be convicted of voluntary 
           manslaughter even though the use of deadly force complied with the other requirements of self-defense. An instigator, or person using 
           excessive force, is not excused from all criminal liability, but may be guilty of a lesser degree of homicide.

         <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
           A citizen may intervene and use deadly force in defense of another person when, under the facts and circumstances, it reasonably 
           appeared necessary to save the other person from an imminent threat of death, great bodily harm, or sexual assault, but only to 
           the extent the other person was entitled to use deadly fore in self defense.

           Excessive force in defense of others is not allowed, and neither the intervener nor the person threatened can be an instigator 
           voluntarily provoking the conflict for deadly force to be used. If you are not sure of the circumstances that initiated the action, 
           it would be advisable to contact a law enforcement agency or attempt to assist using less lethal means rather than immediately 
           imposing the threat of deadly force. ​

       <div style="text-align: left;">
         a-1. To stop a simple assault​.<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
            While a simple assault may be truly terrifying, the law only allows the victim to resist force with 
            equivalent force. Force used to resist a simple assault must be proportionate to the assault. Even a real and legitimate fear 
            of greater injury, standing alone, does not justify use of deadly force.<br><br>
            
            When does a simple assault become an imminent threat of death? When can a victim use deadly force to repel an unarmed attacker? 
            The exact point in time a simple assault becomes aggravated or deadly in nature is often unclear. Repeated blows to vital body 
            areas, choking, continued beating on a helpless or weaken victim, are some indicators.​

         a-2. To stop a simple assault​.<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
            Because the law requires retreat from a simple assault, but does not require retreat from a murderous or felonious assault, an 
            assault victim is once again faced with a decision: when does a simple assault become murderous assault? No clear answer exists 
            for the multitude of circumstances constituting an assault.

         c. Because you are a victim of past violence and fear future violence​.<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
           The law requires that there be an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm. The threat must be an imminent danger of death, not 
           remote and uncertain in time and place. If the facts and circumstances are not reasonably apprehended as an immediate danger of death 
           Here and Now, deadly force in self-defense is not allowed as a Justified excuse for homicide.​

         d. Because a trespasser refuses to leave​<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
           Trespassers may be in violation of the law, but the law does not allow deadly force to end the trespass. While non-lethal force is 
           allowed against a trespasser deadly force is not. Old court cases established sequence for using Force to eject trespassers: first, 
           words must be used; second, if words do not work then gentle hands may be laid on the trespasser; if gentle hands do not work, the 
           owner may use whatever force is necessary to remove the trespasser, but may not use of force likely to kill or cause great bodily harm. 
           The prohibition against using deadly force to expel a trespasser does not apply to a trespasser who is immediately threatening death, 
           serious injury, or sexual assault.

            North Carolina law does not give a citizen the right to make a citizen's arrest.  Since the power to make a citizen's arrest does not 
            exist, the right to use deadly force to affect an arrest or prevent escape is not given to citizens. No matter how serious a crime a

       <h4>Use of Force to Protect Property:</h4>
       <div style="text-align: left;">
         <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
		         The law does not permit the use of deadly force solely to protect property, or to prevent theft, or to regain stolen property. An owner can 
		         defend his or her property using reasonable and necessary Force but not deadly force. Non-deadly force to regain possession of stolen 
		         property is lawful, if it is both reasonable and necessary under the circumstances. An owner CANNOT shoot at a thief; before, during, or 
		         after theft. The same rule prohibits deadly force to prevent injury or vandalism to property. ​

        <div style="text-align: left;">
          <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
            A different rule applies if life is imminently threatened at the same time the property is taken. For example, an armed robbery is theft 
            through use or threatened use of a deadly weapon. The victim is allowed to respond to the imminent threat to the life of an armed robbery by 
            using deadly force. Deadly force to prevent an armed robbery is force used to protect the life, not to protect property. If only property is 
            threatened, deadly force cannot be used.​​

​          (1) Definition of a handgun​<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;A handgun is defined as a firearm that has a short stock and is designed to be held and fired by the use of

        <div style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: smaller;">
          The definition of a handgun has two characteristics in the statute.<br><br>
          First, the firearm must have a short stock. <br><br>
          Second, the firearm must be designed to be held and fired by the use of a single hand. <br><br>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Revolvers and semi-automatic pistols are treated alike. </li>
            <li>Caliber of the firearm is not specified. </li>
            <li>While length or configuration of the firearm’s stock is not defined, presumably it must be shorter than the standard

           &nbsp;&nbsp;The statue further requires the concealed weapon be about the person, which generally means it must be concealed

          3 - Escalation of Force <span style="color: red">make sure numbering is correct</span><br><br>
          
           Escalation of force is merely the increase in the level of force based on that force which is being used against you. Force must be proportionate to the level of force used against you. For instance if you are verbally assaulted you cannot use deadly force to settle the argument. If we were to look at the various levels of force, the escalation would become something like this:​
           
            Physical presence
              Verbal
                Soft hands
                  Hard hands
                    Chemicals  (mace, OC spray)​
                      Impact weapons  (stick, club)​

          The increase in force does not need to follow these various levels. Depending on the level that is used against you and the 
          imminent threat imposed against you, will determine the lawful reaction to the situation.
